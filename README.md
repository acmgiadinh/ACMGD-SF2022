# ACM Gia Định at Science Fair 2022

In 20/05/2022, we ACM Gia Định had a chance to set up a stall at Science Fair, hosted by Gia Dinh High School. At this event, we proudly brought to the fair's participants a nice problem where everyone can interact and try a variety of approaches, as well as being able to relate to many interesting practice problem.

## Problem
A group of Interworld Heroes are making their way through a village. Suddenly, afflatus tells them something is coming. Listening carefully to the portent, the Heroes find out that devils are coming to the houses on the road they are standing. They also know exactly which time the devils approach for each of the houses. The problem is the Heroes cannot move quick enough to rescue all the houses and they must be together for maximum strength. To be precise, there is a maximum speed that they cannot exceed. Therefore, they have to set a journey to rescue as many houses as possible.

### Player's Perspective
For simplicity, in the problem version at Science Fair, we decided to fix the maximum speed of the Heroes to `5` (length unit/time unit).

The players were given a paper strip for each problem instance including coordinates from `-30` to `30` on a axis and corresponding attacked times at the positions of each house, as well as some house models placed on it.

### Input Format
You could view the samples that we used at Science Fair in folder [problem instances](/problem%20instances/), or use them as inputs to your code. The samples are in the following format:
- The first line contains two integers `V` and `N` representing the maximum speed of the Interworld Heroes (since we fixed the number, `V` in every cases of the samples is `5`) and the number of houses on the road.
- The second line contains `N` integers representing the corresponding coordinates of `N` houses.
- The third line contains `N` integers representing the corresponding attacked time of `N` houses.
