# Input Format
You could view the samples that we used at Science Fair here, or use them as inputs to your code. Assume that the Heroes are at the coordinate `0`, the samples are in the following format:
- The first line contains two integers `V` and `N` representing the maximum speed of the Interworld Heroes (since we fixed the number, `V` in every cases of the samples is `5`) and the number of houses on the road.
- The second line contains `N` integers representing the corresponding coordinates of `N` houses.
- The third line contains `N` integers representing the corresponding attacked time of `N` houses, counted from the present.

# Cheatsheets
We also have corresponding cheatsheets of each instance for game masters to host games better. You could view them in folder [cheatsheets](cheatsheets).
